## Instructions

### The batter
- In a microwavable bowl, combine the rice flour, tapioca starch, water, vegetable oil and salt. Stir well to dissolve. 
- Optional: Set aside for 30 minutes to reduce the strong flour smell.
- Before putting it into the microwave, stir up the batter again. 
- Microwave for 2 minutes. 
- Take out and stir well. 
- Then microwave for 1 more minute. 
- Take out and stir well. 
- Then microwave for 1 last minute. (That means we microwave the batter in total 4 minutes with 2 breaks for stirring). You will get a rice flour paste.
- Transfer the paste into an 18x18cm (7x7 inch) square mold greased with some vegetable oil. 

### The rice cake
- Flatten the surface with a spoon or spatula. 
- Then steam the paste for 30-40 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean. 
- Let cool and refrigerate overnight.
- Remove the cake from the mold, cut into rectangular cubes in the size of a domino 5x2x1 cm (2x1x0.5 inch). Divide into 2 portions. We will fry each portion individually for one serving.

### Cook 1 batch
- Mix each rice flour cake portion with 1 tsp black soy sauce.
- In a frying pan (preferably a heavy cast-iron skillet) on medium high heat, add 1 tbsp vegetable oil. 
- Then add the rice flour cake cubes and pan-fry both sides until crispy golden brown. It should take about 7-8 minutes each side.
- Then crack 2 eggs into the pan and break the yolks to bind the rice flour cubes together. 
- Top up with 2-3 tbsp chopped spring onion and cook for 1-2 minutes until the egg is slightly set. 
- Then flip it over to cook the other side for another 1 minute

### Dipping Sauce
- To make the dipping sauce, Combine soy sauce, sugar and vinegar together and stir well to dissolve. 
- Add some chopped chili if needed.

### Garnish
- Transfer to a serving plate and top up with the pickles. 
- Drizzle some sauce over the plate, mix well and serve.
